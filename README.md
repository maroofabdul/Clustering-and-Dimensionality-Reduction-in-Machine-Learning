# Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction in Machine Learning

This project demonstrates unsupervised learning techniques using the Wholesale Customer Dataset. The main objective is to explore and compare dimensionality reduction methods (PCA) and clustering algorithms (KMeans and DBSCAN) for discovering meaningful patterns in customer data.

## 🗂 Dataset
- **Wholesale Customers Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

## 🧪 Techniques Applied
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Scaling using StandardScaler
- Dimensionality Reduction using PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- Clustering using:
  - K-Means (with Elbow Method to determine optimal k)
  - DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)
- Cluster Evaluation using:
  - Silhouette Score
  - Davies-Bouldin Index

## 📊 Visualizations
- PCA Scatter Plots
- K-Means and DBSCAN Cluster Visualizations
- Elbow Curve

## 🧠 Key Findings
- PCA explained 72.46% of variance using two components
- DBSCAN showed a higher Silhouette Score compared to KMeans

## 📎 Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 📁 Deliverables
- Well-documented code notebook
- Visualizations and evaluation plots
- Final project report in PDF format
